## What is this
The main.py file is the basics code that interacts with the OpenAI API

# How to Use
This code needs the correct OpenAI Python Libraries. Be sure to pip install 'requirements.txt' before use

Even then this code will not work on pull, this is because it does not have the API key
I cannot upload the API key to github because then anybody could see it
If you wish to use the code, ask Aidan for the key and put it in a file named "chatKEY.txt" in your directory

Please use the code to a limited degree as it will charge for every use (not a lot but dont break my wallet)
